# school-carpool-project
Although this project will have barely anything to do with carpool, we have to name it such.
This of course, is out of respect to the original idea for this project which was to create a new carpool system for our school because the one they have is terrible. With that being said we are going to mostly drop everything that has to do with a carpool system and actually create a system that will become a competitor of sorts to google classroom.
