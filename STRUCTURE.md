# Structure

## Project

The School Carpool Project will have all code files in the /src/ folder. Wow, isn't that simple. All data for people and school will temporarily go under /data/ until the database works.
Website files go under /web/ until further change. Temporary files that will be read by the front end and deleted by the back end go under /tmp/.
**Use JSON files for data transfer of any kind.**
We will later create a SQL database for data transfer.

## The Fitness Gram Pacer Test
